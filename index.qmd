## A computational materials scientist always programming some stuff
Hello, I'm Rogério, a soon-to-be PhD in Materials Science. My academic work has been focused on using physics and machine learning to discover insights in energy materials. 

I'm enthusiastic about programming, data science, and AI, and I'm dedicated to improving productivity while exploring fresh horizons in my academic work and development projects.

This website blends my work portfolio with a digital garden, housing information on past projects, ongoing work, and my learning journey. Explore my digital world <ᵠ|[here](/notebook/index.qmd)|ᵠ>.


<!-- Hello, I'm Rogério. I'm about to complete my PhD in Materials Science, where I focus on using physics and machine learning to discover new insights in energy materials.

I'm passionate about programming, data science, and AI. I'm always looking for better tools to improve my productivity, whether it's for my academic work, programming projects, or language learning.

My favorite programming language is Python, but I can also work with JavaScript, C++, and Fortran.

This website is a mix of my work portfolio and a digital garden. Here, you can find information about my past projects, work in progress, and notes on things I'm learning.

Feel free to explore my digital world <ᵠ|[here](/notebook/index.qmd)|ᵠ>. -->
